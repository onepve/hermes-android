 * pairs that bring the server-side LLM up to speed on what the user did via
 * voice. Without this, follow-up text questions like "did that work?" hit
 * the LLM with no prior context and get hallucinated answers.
 *
 * Why a single field instead of three booleans + nullable strings on
 * [ChatMessage]: keeps the ChatMessage surface small and makes the "this is
 * a voice-intent trace, treat it specially" check a single null-vs-non-null
 * comparison rather than a multi-field rule that would drift over time.
 *
 * @property toolName The Hermes plugin tool name the intent maps to
 *   (`android_open_app`, `android_send_sms`, etc.). Matches the names the
 *   gateway-side LLM tools use when it calls the same actions itself. Must
 *   start with `android_` to be a valid sync target — the builder uses this
 *   prefix as a sanity gate when constructing the synthetic tool_call.
 * @property argumentsJson Compact JSON object with the args the intent
 *   resolved to, e.g. `{"app_name":"Chrome","package":"com.android.chrome"}`
 *   for an Open App dispatch. Stored as a string so we can hand it straight
 *   to the OpenAI `function.arguments` field, which is itself a JSON-encoded
 *   string by spec. Must be valid JSON.
 * @property success True if the local dispatch returned a 200-class status,
 *   false on any other status (denial, permission missing, dispatcher
 *   failure, etc.). Drives whether the synthetic `tool`-role response
 *   includes an `error` field.
 * @property resultJson Compact JSON object describing the dispatch outcome.
 *   On success, typically `{"ok":true,...}` with any tool-specific fields
 *   from [com.hermesandroid.relay.network.shared.LocalDispatchResult.resultJson].
 *   On failure, an error envelope including `ok:false`, `error`, optionally
 *   `error_code`. Stored as a string and rendered verbatim into the
 *   synthetic `tool`-role message's `content` field.
 * @property syncedToServer Idempotency guard. Flipped to true by
 *   [com.hermesandroid.relay.network.upstream.ChatHandler.markVoiceIntentsSynced]
